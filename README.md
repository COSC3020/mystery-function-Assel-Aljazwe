# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    // Base case: If the array consists of a single element, return that element directly.
    // This condition effectively stops the recursion, as it signifies that the function has
    // broken down the problem to its simplemost level, where no further division is necessary.
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    // Recursion occurs here, it calls the mystery function with a smaller version of the initial array achieved by the slice function which in this case removes the first element of the array.
    // Then the state of the call is saved on a call stack which is used later on.
    // The function will continue to keep calling itself until base case.
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    // After the recursive call, the function compares the largest element it found in the smaller array (foo) with the first element of the current part of the array (a[0])
    // This comparison is done with the array as it was during the time of the call which is saved thanks to the call stack.
    // Moreover, this is where the recursion begins to build itself back up, by returning the largest value found.
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo; // If foo is the largest, it remains the largest value.
    else return a[0]; // Else if a[0] is larger, it becomes the new largest value.
}
```
In simple terms, the mystery function utilizes recursion to find the largest element in any given array. It works by breaking down the problem into smaller parts using recursion calls on smaller arrays, and then it builds back up to the original array size, using the call stack to remember and compare values that were previously sliced. During each recursive call, the function compares the current element with the largest element found in what is left of the array and this process constantly repeats until the final result is the largest value found in the entire array.
